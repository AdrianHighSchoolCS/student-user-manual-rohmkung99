## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: A letter </p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: Sometime private talk sometime front of the class </p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way: A talk private</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: Something privately somethingin front of the class </p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is: Timely</p>
